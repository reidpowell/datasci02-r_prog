1. Basic Requirements (First Evaluation Section)
** valid GitHub URL containing a git repository
** one commit beyond the original fork
** SHA-1 indicating a specific commit in the GitHub repository
** SHA-1 corresponds to a specific commit in the repository
2. Detailed Requirements (Second Evaluation Section, Overall Evaluation)
** The R file contains code implementing the complete assignment
** Both functions have corresponding explanatory comments in the R file
** makeCacheMatrix: The solution appears to be correct and is written in a well-formatted and easily readable style
cacheSolve: The solution appears to be correct and is written in a well-formatted and easily readable style
